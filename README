Interface to Phenix (https://phenix-online.org) tools in ChimeraX. Under early
development - the initial plan is to provide a series of ChimeraX command-line
commands implementing various useful Phenix methods as subprocess calls.

Building instructions:

Linux/MacOS or Windows with Cygwin:

Download and install ChimeraX (1.0 or later)
Clone this repo and change to the chimerax-phenix directory. If you do:

export RELEASE=1

... then the Makefile will look for ChimeraX in the default installation
locations:

(Linux) chimerax
(MacOS) /Applications/ChimeraX.app/Contents/bin/Chimerax
(Windows) C:\Program Files\ChimeraX\bin\Chimerax-console.exe

otherwise it will look for it at:

(Linux) chimerax-daily
(MacOS) /Applications/ChimeraX_Daily.app/Contents/bin/Chimerax
(Windows) C:\Program Files\ChimeraX_Daily\bin\Chimerax-console.exe

To build, simply do:

make app-install


To build in Windows without Cygwin, do:

\path\to\ChimeraX\bin\ChimeraX-console.exe --nogui --cmd "devel install .; exit"


On next starting ChimeraX, new commands should be available as "phenix {command} {args}".
